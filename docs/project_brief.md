# Project Brief

## Project Name:
Vibe Coding Data Science Template

## Overview:
The Vibe Coding Data Science Template delivers a production-ready starting point for analytics and machine-learning teams, bundling opinionated tooling, documentation, and automation so projects launch with consistent quality, observability, and reproducibility from day one.

## Key Objectives:
- Provide a fully configured repository skeleton aligned with the Vibe Coding System.
- Enable automated quality gates (linting, testing, security scans) that run locally and in CI.
- Document workflows, checklists, and decision logs that keep AI + human collaborators aligned.

## Target Audience:
Data science leads and platform teams who need a reusable, automated foundation for new analytics or ML initiatives.

## Key Features/Deliverables:
- Ready-to-use repo with Prefect flows, data/model stubs, tests, and CI pipeline.
- Comprehensive documentation site covering standards, playbooks, and templates.
- Session logging and governance framework to coordinate human and AI contributors.

## Success Metrics:
- New projects can adopt the template and run all checks within one working day.
- CI pipeline remains green across template updates and downstream forks.
- Documentation stays current (≤1 week lag) with changes recorded in changelog and session logs.

## Timeline (High-Level):
- **Start Date:** 2025-11-04
- **Target Completion:** 2026-01-31
